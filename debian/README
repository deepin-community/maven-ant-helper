The Debian Package maven-ant-helper
-----------------------------------

This package provides helper scripts for anyone packaging Java components
within Debian. It will be particularly useful when packaging libraries using
"modello" to generate sources, such as the maven2 system.

It provides two scripts and one ant task:

    * maven-build.xml -- a base build file providing much of the functionality
                         needed to build Java projects.
    * maven-defaults.properties -- default properties for the above.
    * ModelloTask -- provides an "modello" ant task to generate sources
                     from Modello definitions.

For an example of how to use maven-ant-helper, please see the Debian packaging
of "doxia".
